# BaCKSTEP
Experimentation with software back-porting to NeXTSTEP.

## Goals
* Record build process for repeatibility and maintenance;
* Institute a system for transforming source packages into Installer.app packages;
* Release built software as a directly usable product for all NeXTians;
* Be a foundation for a KISS package management (eg list, search, install, remove) process for said NeXTians and their machines.
